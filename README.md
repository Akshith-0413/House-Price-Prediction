## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a model that can predict the price of a house based on its features using linear regression. Linear regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about various houses, including:
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Size (square feet)
- Location
- Year built
- And other relevant features

* Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

 Usage
1. Prepare the dataset:
   Ensure your dataset is in the correct format and placed in the designated directory.

2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. Make predictions:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input data/input.csv --output data/output.csv
   ```

Results
The performance of the linear regression model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score. These metrics help in understanding the accuracy and efficiency of the model.
